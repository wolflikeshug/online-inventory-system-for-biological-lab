Intro Email to Client 

Simon suggested getting the email out over the weekend so we can meet with the client early in the week two.

All agreed. 

Daniel discusses the possibility of putting ideas forward for the client in our intro email 

Leyton reads out the full details of the proposal that we have and the team decides there may not be enough information to do this.   

Team decides to make a minimal intro email with nothing more than an introduction and a request for availability so we can setup a meeting next week. 

Suggested parts of the email 

    Introduction 
    Request the confidentiality document 
        Suggestion that the sooner we can get this out the faster we can start
    Ask for availability of the client 
    Ask for any other information that we can get prior to meeting to help get up to speed 


Simon tasked to write the email
