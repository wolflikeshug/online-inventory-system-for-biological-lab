**10am Meeting start**
Dealing with patient info – security
Individual logins for each of members – can use uwa pheme login
Stratification of who can do what
Only uwa users will use
They are not programming people
Possible to use university servers?
Data currently stored on university servers
Patient samples – rough demographic - initials, dob, collection date, etc -multiple tubes, multiple locations
Data needs to be stored in specific slot (on chess-board looking setup)
More user friendly – like lab collector

For a patient- have all their samples linked – click on person have all their stuff linked

Ability to sort by date – specific timepoints

Would like ability to link sample info to samples in data storage – they currently store their info differently for each person working on samples 
Not doing diagnostics – just keeping track of stuff

**10:10pm**
Track what goes in, what goes out
Thousands of samples
Number of samples will vary overtime
Would like to bulk import samples
MAJOR ISSUE- When someone takes something out, the data is lost- have ability to transfer test tube to different location.
All data doesn’t leave lab.
Will just be working with sample and code

**10:20**
Need to host database – internally with uwa? Within lab building?
Major concern- security of info
Don’t need to access from home
May need to work offline – can make changes elsewhere and then sync back to network
Students need access to lab’s drive ( irds institutional research data store) from Allison to access info
Can get a lot of space to store data

**10:30**
How to host database and website – discuss with uwa I.T., laptop in lab?

**10:40**
Agreed to communicate through email and face-to-face meeting when needed
MINIMUM - being able to trace what happens to specimens – who does what to each specimen – in a way that is user-friendly.
Don’t care about operating systems / programming languages
Maybe store how much of a specimen is left in a tube
Show what has happened to a sample – has it been freeze stored?-would lose part of it, put a tag on the sample?

**10:50**
Wants – locating supplies that come in. Inventory of products that come in- where its sitting (not samples – supplies).
Not going to show us data – don’t need to sign confidentiality agreement

**11:00 Meeting end**
Freezer-> has different samples->each sample has patient info/time of collection->samples are linked to multiple different datasets.
