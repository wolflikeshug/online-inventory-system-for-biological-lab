# Limitations to the website
**The following information is very important so please read before using the website**

- No validation for import: User will have to fix excel themselves or put the vials in manually. Will try and give more validation in coming week.

- No field for last used date: If user wants to record it, use the notes.

- Can't change user details: Ask Allison to delete user's account, and they can make another.

- Incomplete data input validation for search: user needs to make sure they search properly. (eg. don't put letters in volume field)

- Not able to split a sample into multiple samples: user can create a sample and duplicate it.

- No tag functionality (eg. can't mark a sample as freeze stored (thawed? idk)): They can add info to notes and search for them by notes.

- Usernames are Case sensitive so be carefull when logging back in

- Import date must be one format: right now it's set to dd/MM/yyyy (please specify if otherwise)

- Need to have a building, room and fridge in database before using import (being fixed currently)
